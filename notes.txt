Below is a high-level code-review of both the backend (Flask) and frontend (Nuxt 3) parts of the repository, plus some DevOps / project-hygiene observations. None of the items require immediate fixes to keep the project running, but tackling them will pay off in maintainability, security and deployment readiness.
1 . Backend (Flask)
1.1 Configuration & security
debug=True is hard-coded in both backend/app.py and backend/run.py.
⟹ Read it from an env-var (FLASK_DEBUG) or use a Config class (you already drafted this in TODO).
CORS is enabled for all origins. In production narrow this down or use a whitelist read from CORS_ORIGINS.
success_response / error_response sometimes return the raw Python exception message—this can leak internals. Sanitize or log internally only.
SECRET_KEY is missing; Flask will fall back to an unsafe default. Place it in .env and load via python-dotenv or similar.
1.2 Structure & duplication
run.py merely imports app and calls app.run(), duplicating the if __name__ == '__main__' block inside app.py. Pick one entry-point (prefer flask run or a WSGI server such as Gunicorn).
Static data lives in a huge dictionary (portfolio_data.py). Consider:
moving it to JSON/YAML files (easier editing, validation) or
a light SQLite/SQL-Alchemy model if you foresee CRUD requirements.
All routes are GET-only. A POST /contact endpoint could receive form data and e-mail you, etc.
1.3 Error handling & logging
@app.errorhandler(Exception) catches everything but still returns HTTP 500 with the same body as the dedicated 500 handler—this is fine, but add structured logging (e.g. logging.config.dictConfig) so unhandled errors reach a log file / Sentry.
Rate-limiting (Flask-Limiter) and request-time-outs help protect the free API.
1.4 Testing
There is no test suite. Even a handful of pytest cases that hit every endpoint would protect you against accidental regressions.
2 . Frontend (Nuxt 3 + TS + Tailwind)
2.1 Runtime config
nuxt.config.ts hard-codes apiBase: 'http://localhost:5000/api/v1'.
⟹ Use process.env.NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE (Nuxt 3 automatically exposes public keys) so dev, staging and prod URLs differ only by env-vars.
2.2 API wrapper (useApi.ts)
Good start, but consider:
Adding Zod or valibot to type-validate the response payloads.
Centralising error-to-toast mapping instead of console.error.
Removing $fetch’s retry options in production and delegate retries to the backend (avoids duplicate inserts etc.).
2.3 Component behaviour
In ProjectsSection.vue you call await useAsyncData at module-scope. For client-side navigation this is fine, but on the server it runs at build time as well. Wrap it in a defineAsyncData composable or use the new route-rules to avoid hitting the API during static generation when deploying to Netlify/Vercel.
Watchers that use nextTick for GSAP animations fire every time you navigate back to the page; make sure to ScrollTrigger.kill() or you’ll accumulate event listeners.
2.4 Accessibility & SEO
Components lack basic ARIA attributes (e.g. navigation landmarks) and semantic tags (<nav>, <main>).
Add meta/og:* tags per page via useHead().
Set page language in app.head.htmlAttrs.
2.5 Performance
The TODO already mentions Nuxt Image. Also enable Nitro asset caching headers with:
Apply
Tree-shake GSAP by importing only the pieces you use (import { gsap } from 'gsap'; & ScrollTrigger plugin).
3 . Dev Ops / Project hygiene
3.1 Repository
.nuxt/ and .output/ directories exist locally but are ignored in .gitignore—make sure they never got committed earlier (git rm -r --cached).
Commit a pre-commit config (black/ruff for Python, eslint/prettier for Vue) to keep code style consistent.
3.2 CI/CD
Add a simple GitHub Actions workflow:
python -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt && pytest
npm ci --prefix frontend && npm run lint --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend
Cache pip and npm directories to speed up builds.
3.3 Docker
Your TODO already sketches a docker-compose.yml. A multi-stage Dockerfile for the frontend (build → nginx alpine) and backend (gunicorn) will let you deploy anywhere in one command.
3.4 Documentation
Add a short README.md that explains local setup, env-vars, and one-liner for running both services (make dev).
4 . Quick-win checklist
☑ Move debug & SECRET_KEY to env-vars; add a Config class.
☑ Drop duplicate app.run in run.py or in app.py.
☑ Add pytest with one test per endpoint.
☑ Replace hard-coded apiBase in Nuxt with env-var.
☑ Kill GSAP ScrollTriggers on unmount to avoid leaks.
☑ Implement ARIA labels and OG tags (improves Lighthouse score).
☑ Set up GitHub Actions to lint / test on every push.
Addressing the items above will make the portfolio production-ready, easier to maintain, and kinder to end-users.
